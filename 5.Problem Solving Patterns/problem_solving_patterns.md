## Common Patterns for Solving Problems
Methodolgy to follow to solve common types of problems.

Some patterns include:
* Frequency Counter
* Multiple Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking

### Frequency Counter
* Useful when you need to compare multiple inputs.
* This pattern uses objects or sets of objects to collect values/frequencies of values.
* This is often O(n) and can avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings.
