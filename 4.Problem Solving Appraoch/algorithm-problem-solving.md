# Algorithm Problem Solving

### Algorithms are simply a set of steps or instructions to complete a task

## Problem Solving Approach
1. Understand the problem
  Always make sure to understand the task at hand to clarify details.
  - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem
  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

2. Explore Concrete Examples
  - Provide sanity checks so that you're moving in the right directoin.
  - Examples helps you understand the problem better. (think unit tests or user stories).
  - Start with simpler examples, or pieces of the issue.
  - Progress to more complex examples.
  - Explore examples with errors or empty inputs.

3. Break it Down
  - Write out the actual steps of the problem (comments as a guide/pseudocode).
  - Communicate what you mean and are after.  Ask questions or explain your logic explicitly. 
  - Think about your code before you write it.
  - Catch lingering questions or gaps in your implementation.

4. Solve/Simplify
  - Write in your code (not the last step oftentimes!)
  - Solve the problem. If you can't, solve a simpler problem!!! Ignore the part giving you issues and solve the rest.
      - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
      - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
      - Write a simplified solution
      - Then incorporate difficulty back in
  
5. Look Back and Refactor
  - If something just works, that's fine, but it's great to strive for better!
        - Can you check the result?
        - Can you derive the result differently?
        - Can you understand it easily at a glance?
        - Can you use the result or method for another problem?
        - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
        - How have other people solved this problem differently?
