# Algorithm Problem Solving

### Algorithms are simply a set of steps or instructions to complete a task

## Problem Solving Approach
1. Understand the problem
  Always make sure to understand the task at hand to clarify details.
  - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem
  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor
